This system uses Flask to conduct interactive and presentation functions. Brief instructions for how a user would interact with your program. First, for every attribute the movie, the system would first ask whether they have requirement for that certain attribute, and then would be more specific about what their requirement is. Then, after this is done, the system would randomly select a movie that meet the users’ need. If there is not a movie that would satisfy the user, the system would recommend the user to try again. Lastly, the system would inform the user about the recommended movie’s title and would jump to the movie’s IMDb web page for further information. It would also provide with a list of 25 reviews of the movie.
